# Rules to follow when working on Xcode projects and SwiftUI projects

- NEVER RUN BUILDS OR ANY COMMANDS REGARDING THE PROJECT BUILD PROCESS.
- Always output a summary of the files you added so they can be added manually in xcode for it to recognize them.
- Remember, linter errors can persists, after you fix them, I and only I need to rebuild the project to see the changes and hopefully the linter errors will be fixed.

THESE RULES HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED AT ALL TIMES.
